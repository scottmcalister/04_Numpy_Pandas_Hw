Three Observable Trends:

1.	The Total count of players broken down by gender is directly proportional to the purchase count based on gender, and the total purchase value, with a factor of roughly 4.6.  
2.	I was somewhat surprised after visualizing the total count and percentage of players within each age group.  While it is rational to me that the 20-24 age group has well and away the most people in it, I would have thought that the 25-29 age group would have had more those 87 total players.  Maybe I’m biased because I’m in the age bracket and all of my friends play these types of games.
3.	Looking at the whole data set, I thought the top purchase counts would be higher.  Games like this usually require a lot of micropurchases, so while the average purchase price makes sense, I thought the Purchase count would be a lot higher.  Maybe the data is from a very short amount of time, but I’ve heard of people spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on games like this, so I’m surprised there weren’t any outliers to reflect that.
